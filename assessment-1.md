[Form UI](https://i.imgur.com/jwCvR3o.png)


### instructions
- build both pages in React
- form should be fillable. each disease on the form is a <br /> collapsible tab that shows the form fields for the disease, when clicked.
- for each disease, when status is no, medication and diagnosis type should be disabled. they should be enabled when status is yes.
- once the form is saved, redirect the user to the report page. show the <br /> details which the user entered, on this report page.
- page styling should be just as is implemented on the designs.
